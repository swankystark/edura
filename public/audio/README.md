# Audio Files for Focus Room

## How to Add YouTube Audio Library Tracks

Since YouTube doesn't allow direct audio streaming, you need to download tracks from the YouTube Audio Library and place them here.

### Steps:

1. **Go to YouTube Audio Library**
   - Visit: https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music
   - All tracks are free and no-copyright

2. **Download Tracks**
   - Search for these types of music:
     - **Rain**: Search "rain" or "rain ambience"
     - **Forest**: Search "forest birds" or "nature sounds"
     - **Cafe**: Search "cafe" or "coffee shop ambience"
     - **White Noise**: Search "white noise" or "ambient noise"
     - **Ocean**: Search "ocean waves" or "beach sounds"
     - **Space**: Search "space ambient" or "cosmic sounds"

3. **Rename and Place Files**
   - Download the tracks
   - Rename them to match these exact names:
     - `rain.mp3`
     - `forest.mp3`
     - `cafe.mp3`
     - `white-noise.mp3`
     - `ocean.mp3`
     - `space.mp3`
   - Place all files in this `public/audio/` folder

4. **That's it!**
   - The app will automatically use these local files
   - If a file is missing, it will fallback to online sources

### Alternative: Use Other Free Music Sources

You can also use tracks from:
- **Pixabay**: https://pixabay.com/music/
- **Free Music Archive**: https://freemusicarchive.org/
- **Incompetech**: https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/

Just make sure they're royalty-free and no-copyright, then rename them as above.
